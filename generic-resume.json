    "brief": "I am entrenched in human interaction and how that translates to code. I love learning new languages and challenge my self constantly. I feel I would be a strong resource on any team.  I received my interactive media design degree from the Art Institute of California in 2008. After graduating I began working for Pacific Sunwear clothing as a front end developer. Quickly after joining I was promoted to Sr. Front End Developer. I learned quickly that working on a small team (2 developers) wasn't enough for me so I took a position with JP Morgan Chase and moved to San Francisco. I've grown a lot since then and now manage a team for JP Morgan Chase in Seattle.",

For the next year I was given projects that were in amber or red status and asked to solve tough code and proccess problems. During that time I was able to grow as a developer and as a leader. Our team maintained and built UI components that were part of a larger ASP/.Net framework used by hundreds of developers at Chase. Less then 2 years after I was hired I was promoted to Vice President and asked to build and support a new UI Library on JavaScript based framework.",
