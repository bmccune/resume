## EMPLOYMENT

### *Software Development Manager*, [JP Morgan Chase](https://chase.com) (2013-01 — 2017-01)

I am a Software Development Lead for J.P. Morgan Chase. I oversee front end web development projects for the firm from a technical framework standpoint and provide all documentation and code deliveries for a given project. I also manage a team of developers that work both on the same projects as me as well as other projects within the firm. I'm involved in a project from start to finish (scoping, design, development, qa, and launch). I work with all stakeholders to insure the final product is what's expected when it's expected. During my time with the firm I've drastically increased code quality utilizing new tools and processes. I've also implemented a code monitoring system to insure compliance across the firm. Single handily migrated a third party prototype application in house using Ruby on Rails, a language I previously had no experience with. Which in turn reduced costs to maintain the prototype. I've was instrumental in the building of some of the firms first responsive applications that work on both desktop and mobile. My team and I will continue to make the Chase.com applications the best in the banking industry!

### *Online Editor*, [Bonnier Publications](http://www.bonniercorp.com/brands/) (2007-08 — 2008-10)

I was the online editor for www.quadmagazine.com. This entailed working with multiple advertisers to develop articles and test products on all the latest ATV trends. I took photos, video, edited both, wrote articles, and interviewed industry professionals. I was let go almost exactly after a year due to restructuring and new ownership. In my short time at QUAD, I was able to increase traffic, site content and quality, increase customer interaction, and over all took the website to the next level. I was able to also increase the revenue for the website due to the increase in traffic.
