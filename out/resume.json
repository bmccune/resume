    "summary": "I am entrenched in human interaction and how that translates to code. I love learning new languages and challenge my self constantly. I feel I would be a strong resource on any team.  I received my interactive media design degree from the Art Institute of California in 2008. After graduating I began working for Pacific Sunwear clothing as a front end developer. Quickly after joining I was promoted to Sr. Front End Developer. I learned quickly that working on a small team (2 developers) wasn't enough for me so I took a position with JP Morgan Chase and moved to San Francisco. I've grown a lot since then and now manage a team for JP Morgan Chase in Seattle.",

When I began the project, the team was being assigned 8-10 defects a day, with some changes to how we delievered and triaged defects that count quickly became 1-2 a day and we were able to meet our code lock dates. For the next year I was given projects that were in amber or red status and asked to solve tough code and proccess problems. During that time I was able to grow as a developer and as a leader. Our team maintained and built UI components that were part of a larger ASP/.Net framework used by hundreds of developers at Chase.
